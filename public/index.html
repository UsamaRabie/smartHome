            What is IoT
          </h3>

          <p>
            The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors,
            software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems
            over the internet. These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools. With more
            than 7 billion connected IoT devices today, experts are expecting this number to grow to 10 billion by 2020 and 22
            billion by 2025. Oracle has a network of device partners.
          </p>

          <h2 >Why is Internet of Things (IoT) so important?</h2>
          <p>Over the past few years, IoT has become one of the most important technologies of the 21st century. Now that we can
            connect everyday objects—kitchen appliances, cars, thermostats, baby monitors—to the internet via embedded devices,
            seamless communication is possible between people, processes, and things.
            By means of low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile technologies, physical things can share
            and collect data with minimal human intervention. In this hyperconnected world, digital systems can record, monitor,
            and adjust each interaction between connected things. The physical world meets the digital world—and they cooperate.
          </p>
          <h2 >What technologies have made IoT possible?</h2>
          <p>While the idea of IoT has been in existence for a long time, a collection of recent advances in a number of
            different technologies has made it practical.
            • Access to low-cost, low-power sensor technology. Affordable and reliable sensors are making IoT technology
            possible for more manufacturers.
            • Connectivity. A host of network protocols for the internet has made it easy to connect sensors to the cloud and to
            other “things” for efficient data transfer.
            • Cloud computing platforms. The increase in the availability of cloud platforms enables both businesses and
            consumers to access the infrastructure they need to scale up without actually having to manage it all.
            • Machine learning and analytics. With advances in machine learning and analytics, along with access to varied and
            vast amounts of data stored in the cloud, businesses can gather insights faster and more easily. The emergence of
            these allied technologies continues to push the boundaries of IoT and the data produced by IoT also feeds these
            technologies.
            • Conversational artificial intelligence (AI). Advances in neural networks have brought natural-language processing
            (NLP) to IoT devices (such as digital personal assistants Alexa, Cortana, and Siri) and made them appealing,
            affordable, and viable for home use.
